THE REMOTE GARAGE DOOR
You just got a new garage door installed. Your son (obviously when you are not home) is having a lot of fun playing with the remote 
clicker, opening and closing the door, scaring your pet dog Siba and annoying the neighbors.
The clicker is a one-button remote that works like this:
If the door is OPEN or CLOSED, clicking the button will cause the door to move, until it completes the cycle of opening or closing.
    Door: Closed -> Button clicked -> Door: Opening -> Cycle complete -> Door: Open.
If the door is currently opening or closing, clicking the button will make the door stop where it is. When clicked again, 
the door will go the opposite direction, until complete or the button is clicked again.
We will assume the initial state of the door is CLOSED.
